As a Machine Learning Researcher at a top FinTech company, I specialize in applying machine learning to credit scoring and customer engagement.

My technical expertise includes Python, PySpark, SQL, Docker, CloudFormation, and Kubernetes, as well as experience building ETL pipelines and deploying machine learning models on cloud platforms such as AWS and AlibabaCloud.

Outside of work, I am passionate about number theory, automation, and web scraping. I am the creator of two Python packages, stableperovskites and shopeepy-wrapped, and I'm currently expanding my skills by learning the Rust programming language.

If you're looking for a machine learning expert with a range of technical skills and a passion for innovation, I would love to connect with you.
